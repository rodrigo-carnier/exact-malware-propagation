% The matrix below represents the state of infection of all devices.
% Every column represents a device. The meaning of each line is:

% (1,:) Address of device. The add is a decimal number from 1 to n
% (2,:) Powered or not.    0 - device is turned off. 1 - device is turned on. -1 - device is turned off but will be reset next turn.
% (3,:) MSM Infected or not.   0 - not ACM infected. 1 - devices's MSM is infected.
% (4,:) ACM Infected or not.   0 - not ACM infected. 1 - devices's ACM is infected.

network(1,:) = 1:param.n;
