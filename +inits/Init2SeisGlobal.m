%% Network matrix

% (1,i) Address of device. The address is a decimal number from 1 to n.
% (2,i) Powered or not (not in use). 0 - device is turned off. 1 - device is turned on. -1 - device is turned off but will be reset next turn.
% (3,i) State of device. S: 1    E: 10    I: 100
% (4,i) Infection Delay. A countdown for every device that moved from S to E.
% (5,i) Type of device. 1: No Exposed transition. 2: Exposed.
