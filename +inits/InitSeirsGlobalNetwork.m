% The matrix below represents the state of infection of all devices.
% Every column represents a device. The meaning of each line is:

% (1,i) Address of device. The address is a decimal number from 1 to n.
% (2,i) Powered or not (not in use). 0 - device is turned off. 1 - device is turned on. -1 - device is turned off but will be reset next turn.
% (3,i) State of device. S: 1    E: 11    I: 21    R: 31    D: 41
% (4,i) Infection Delay. A countdown for every device that moved from S to E.
% (5,i) Recovery Delay. A countdown for every device that moved from I to R.
